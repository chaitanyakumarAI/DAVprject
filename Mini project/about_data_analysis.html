    <h2>Our Survey Data Process</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>The data was collected through an online survey distributed to participants. This method ensured ease of access, real-time data entry, and reduced manual errors. The survey captured participant demographics, healthcare practices, and feedback on challenges with traditional healthcare systems.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>Data cleaning involved removing duplicate entries, filling in missing data where possible, and ensuring consistency in formatting. This step was crucial to ensure data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.</p>

    <h3>3. Pre-processing</h3>
    <p>The pre-processing phase transformed the raw data into a structured format. Categorical variables were encoded, and outliers were handled to minimize bias. This step prepared the data for deeper exploration and modeling.</p>

    <h3>4. Data Exploration</h3>
    <p>In the exploration phase, statistical summaries and visualizations were used to uncover patterns and trends in the data. Insights such as the frequency of healthcare visits and user interest in digital records were identified.</p>

    <h3>5. Data Modeling</h3>
    <p>I havent used any data models like K means clustering,DB Scan or etc.,</p>
